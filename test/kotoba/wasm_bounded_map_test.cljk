  "The bounded `:map` value type reaches wasm32.

  KIR carries two map vocabularies. `typed-map-*` names its own
  `[:map K V]` descriptor at every use and this backend has emitted it since
  the typed value ABI landed. `map-new` / `map-get` / `map-assoc` are the
  BOUNDED map -- what a bare `{:k 1}` literal desugars to -- and until
  `kotoba.wasm.typed/lower-bounded-maps` they reached neither table.

  They refused in two DIFFERENT places with two DIFFERENT messages, and which
  one a program got depended on whether it bound the map to a local:

    (map-get (map-new :value 9) :value 0)          `emit*`'s fallthrough in
                                                   kotoba.wasm.core:
                                                   \"typed Wasm operation is
                                                   not qualified\"
    (let [m (map-new :value 9)] (map-get m ...))   `infer-type` in
                                                   kotoba.wasm.typed:
                                                   \"unsupported typed Wasm
                                                   expression\"

  Closing one alone left the other standing, so both shapes are asserted
  here and neither is a duplicate of the other. Measured 2026-09-01 against
  amu 27d82d8: the first exited 70 with the first message, the second with
  the second, and `(match 5 0 100 5 200 :else 300)` -- no map anywhere --
  compiled and answered 200. The refusal was the map, not `match`."
