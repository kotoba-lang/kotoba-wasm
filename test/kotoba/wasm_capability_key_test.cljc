(ns kotoba.wasm-capability-key-test
  "A module that declares a capability emits on BOTH runtimes.

  The import table pairs each capability import with its lookup through the
  key `[:capability <id>]`, and on ClojureScript an id is a BigInt.
  ClojureScript cannot hash a BigInt at all -- it tries to stamp a
  `closure_uid` property on it and throws -- so the key failed the moment a
  guest declared a capability, while every capability-free module emitted
  fine.

  Measured 2026-08-31 while compiling a guest that holds
  `:dataspace/transact`: `amu check --jvm-free` passed and
  `amu compile --jvm-free --target wasm32-browser` reported an internal
  compiler error. Nothing in this repository had executed a `:cljs` branch --
  every test here was `.clj`, which is the same reason kotoba-kir grew its own
  `run-tests.cljs` on 2026-08-24.

  The capability call below carries `:string` and not `:i64` ON PURPOSE. A
  scalar module takes the i64 value ABI and never reaches the import key: the
  first version of this test used `:i64`, passed with the defect still in
  place, and was only caught by putting the defect back. Do not simplify the
  types."
