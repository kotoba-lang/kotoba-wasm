(ns kotoba.component-heap-test
  "ADR 0076 section 4a, step 1: a component module has a real linear memory and
  a real bump `cm32p2_realloc`.

  A component cannot import `kotoba:typed`/`kotoba:heap`, so anything that is
  not a bare scalar must live in the module's own memory. Until now the emitter
  declared a zero-page memory and a realloc whose whole body was `i32.const 0`.
  These tests run the emitted allocator, rather than inspecting it, because a
  byte-level port is exactly the kind of change that can look right and be
  wrong."
