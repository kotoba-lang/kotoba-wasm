;; The portable side of this suite. `kotoba.wasm.core` is `.cljc` and the amu
;; CLI's JVM-free path emits through it, but every test in `test/` was `.clj`,
;; so until 2026-08-31 the `:cljs` branches had never been executed by
;; anything. One of them used a BigInt as a map key, which ClojureScript
;; cannot hash at all, and emitting any module that declared a capability
;; failed there -- reported by the CLI as an internal compiler error.
;;
;; The same gap kotoba-kir closed with its own runner on 2026-08-24, for the
;; same reason: the fleet gate is `:jvm-test`.
;;
;; Anything added to `test/` as `.cljc` belongs in BOTH lists below -- being
;; required is not being run.
