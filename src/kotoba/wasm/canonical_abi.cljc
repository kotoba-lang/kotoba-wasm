  `layout-leaves`'s existing nested-record recursion clause,

(defn layout-leaves
  "Flatten one record layout (as returned by `layout`) into an ordered list
  of leaves, in the same left-to-right depth-first order as the layout's own
  `:flat` vector. A field whose own layout is itself a nested record layout
  (that is, it carries a `:fields` key) is recursed into so every nested leaf
  gets its own absolute store/load offset; this is how one level of nested
  aggregate lowering reuses the same flat-scalar codegen as a plain record.
  A field whose own layout is a bounded `tuple` (also carries a `:fields` key,
  `structural-product-layout`'s own positional `{:offset :layout}` entries)
  is recursed into by this same clause with no dedicated branch of its own:
  a tuple is a pure fixed-offset product exactly like a nested record, so
  every element's own absolute offset is already the final answer for
  flattening, unlike a list/option/result whose payload interpretation is
  either runtime-length (list) or discriminant-gated (option/result).
  A field whose own layout is a bounded `string`/`keyword` (carries a
  `:max-bytes` key, the same pointer+length linear-memory shape ADR 0040/0041
  already gave bare string parameters/results) is exposed as
  `{:offset :descriptor :max-bytes}` instead of the plain scalar leaf's
  `{:offset :descriptor}`, so callers can tell a two-core-value pointer+length
  leaf from a one-core-value scalar leaf without re-deriving it from the
  descriptor. A field whose own layout is a bounded `list` (carries a
  `:max-items` key, the pointer+length shape `list-layout` above gives a
  bounded `[:list ...]`) is likewise exposed as its own leaf shape,
  `{:offset :descriptor :max-items :item-layout}`, rather than being
  recursed into the way a nested record's `:fields` are: a list's own items
  live in a separately-addressed buffer at a length only known at runtime,
  not at a further fixed offset inside this record's own layout, so there is
  nothing further to flatten here -- `:item-layout` is carried on the leaf
  itself so a caller can still derive the item stride/shape without
  re-deriving it from the descriptor. Every consumer must still bound
  nesting depth before calling this (`layout` itself only rejects unbounded
  recursive schemas, not depth generally)."
